This is a port of the popular [Min Theme](https://github.com/miguelsolorio/min-theme) by Miguel Solorio, bringing its clean and minimalist aesthetic to [Azure Data Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/).

Min Theme is designed for developers who appreciate simplicity and focus. It features soft colors and subtle contrasts to provide a comfortable experience for long coding sessions.
